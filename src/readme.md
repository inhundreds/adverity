Some warning when Spark is starting https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24825

Two kinds of test
- Unit tests
   - we test the behaviour of our code, not Spark
   - we test only public code (https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/35);79860805)
- Integration tests
    - we test the integration of the service with Spark
    - we test the integration between the controller, the service and Spark
